# Notice

This is a fork of Amplify's [Python HCL2](https://github.com/amplify-education/python-hcl2) repository. This repository went through minor changes to work better with [GLITCH](https://github.com/sr-lab/GLITCH) and as the changes concern only the structure representation to be compatible with [GLITCH](https://github.com/sr-lab/GLITCH) we decided not to request updates for the upstream project. The two projects diverge in the representation of some structures and pushing new changes upstream doesn't make sense.

# Python HCL2

A parser for [HCL2](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/blob/hcl2/hclsyntax/spec.md) written in Python using
[Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark). This parser only supports HCL2 and isn't backwards compatible
with HCL v1. It can be used to parse any HCL2 config file such as Terraform.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

python-hcl2 requires Python 3.7 or higher to run.

### Installing

This package can be installed using `pip`

```sh
pip3 install python-hcl2
```

### Usage

```python
import hcl2
with open('foo.tf', 'r') as file:
    dict = hcl2.load(file)
```

## Building From Source

For development, `tox>=4.0.9` is recommended.

### Running Tests

python-hcl2 uses `tox`. You will need to install tox with `pip install tox`.
Running `tox` will automatically execute linters as well as the unit tests.

You can also run them individually with the `-e` argument.

For example, `tox -e py37-unit` will run the unit tests for python 3.7

To see all the available options, run `tox -l`.

## Releasing

To create a new releaes go to Releases page, press 'Draft a new release', create a tag

Github actions will take care of publishing it to PyPi.
